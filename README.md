## Overview

This project uses Python to create various visualizations based on sales data. It includes line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots to help understand the sales trends and patterns over time.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-data-visualization.git
    cd sales-data-visualization
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file should include:
    ```plaintext
    matplotlib
    pandas
    ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the data**:
    Ensure that your sales data is in a CSV file named `sales_data.csv` in the following format:

    ```csv
    Year,Product,Units Sold,Revenue
    2018,Product A,150,3000
    2018,Product B,200,4000
    2018,Product C,250,5000
    2019,Product A,180,3600
    2019,Product B,220,4400
    2019,Product C,260,5200
    2020,Product A,170,3400
    2020,Product B,210,4200
    2020,Product C,240,4800
    2021,Product A,200,4000
    2021,Product B,230,4600
    2021,Product C,270,5400
    2022,Product A,190,3800
    2022,Product B,240,4800
    2022,Product C,280,5600
    ```

2. **Run the visualization script**:
    ```sh
    python sales_visualization.py
    ```

3. **View the generated plots**:
    The script will display several plots that provide insights into the sales data.

## Data

The data used in this project should be a CSV file (`sales_data.csv`) with the following columns:
- `Year`: The year of sales data.
- `Product`: The product name.
- `Units Sold`: The number of units sold.
- `Revenue`: The revenue generated from sales.

## Visualization Examples

### Line Plot
Visualizes revenue over years for each product.

### Bar Chart
Shows total units sold for each product.

### Scatter Plot
Displays the relationship between units sold and revenue.

### Line Plot
Visualizes total revenue over years.
